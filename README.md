# ðŸŽˆ Flood Detection with DMCF-Net
This repository provides the official implementation of DMCF-Net (Dilated Multi-scale Context Fusion Network), a deep learning architecture designed for flood detection in SAR imagery. By fusing multi-scale contextual features and incorporating attention mechanisms, DMCF-Net effectively captures the complex characteristics of flood regions with diverse scattering and blurred boundaries.
